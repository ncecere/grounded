# Page templates

Grounded's page shapes from the UI plan (`docs/ui-review/README.md`, D3–D5, Q13). They're composed from bitop-ui items. Build pages on them rather than laying out headers, tabs, save bars and tables by hand, so every page has the same structure. Tests: `src/test/templates.test.tsx`.

| Template | File | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `DetailPage` | `detail-page.tsx` | A container's page: source, KB, agent, team, user (D3) |
| `SettingsPage`, `SettingsSection`, `DangerZone`, `DangerAction` | `settings-page.tsx` | A Settings tab or settings page (D3, F-17) |
| `useRevisionForm`, `RevisionSaveBar` | `revision-form.ts`, `conflict-notice.tsx` | A settings form over a revisioned object (If-Match): keeps the edits through a save conflict |
| `useUnsavedChangesGuard` | `unsaved-guard.tsx` | Any other page with a `SaveBar` |
| `ListPage`, `useListFilters`, `timeColumn`, `RelativeTime` | `list-page.tsx` | Every list and log (D5) |
| `RecordPage`, `useRecordParam` | `record-page.tsx` | Leaf records: documents, keys, requests, audit entries, crawl runs, models… as a page over their list (D4) |
| `FormPage`, `FormSection`, `useFormParam` | `form-page.tsx` | Long create and edit forms (a source, a connection, a model, a classification level) as a page (D4) |
| `TakeoverPage`, `TakeoverHost` | `takeover.tsx` | What RecordPage and FormPage build on; the shell holds the host |
| `GuardedDialog`, `useCloseGuard`, `useEditTracker` | `close-guard.tsx` | Any other dialog with input: "Leave without saving?" on close (m7) |
| `DateRangeFilter`, `useDateRangeParam` | `date-range-filter.tsx` | Any date range (Q13) |
| `ActionMenu`, `orderActions` | `action-menu.tsx` | The "…" menu (used by the above) |
| `PageActions` | `page-actions.tsx` | A header's secondary buttons, primary and "…" menu for a page on `PageHeader` (DetailPage uses it) |

Words come from `src/lib/terms.ts` (D8): "Passages", not chunks; "Signed-in users"; "Danger zone"; Enabled/Disabled for switchable objects and Active/Retired/Archived/Suspended for lifecycle states.

## DetailPage

```tsx
<DetailPage
  title={source.name}
  meta={<StatusBadge …/>}
  facts={[{ label: "Type", value: "Web" }, { label: "Documents", value: plural(n, "document") }, { label: "Last sync", value: <RelativeTime value={…} /> }]}
  primaryAction={<Button>Sync now</Button>}
  secondaryActions={[{ label: "Chat", icon: <MessageSquare />, render: <Link to="…" /> }]}   // rare: buttons before the primary
  menuActions={[{ label: "Pause", icon: <Pause />, onSelect: pause }, { label: "Delete source", danger: true, onSelect: () => setDeleting(true) }]}
  notices={<ArchivedNotice />}
  tabIds={sourceTabs}                // from lib/tabs.ts, validated by the route with tabSearch()
  tabsLabel="Source sections"
  tabs={[{ value: "overview", label: "Overview", content: … }, { value: "documents", label: "Documents", content: … }, { value: "settings", label: "Settings", content: <SourceSettings /> }]}
/>
```

- One primary action at most. Everything else goes in the "…" menu, and destructive actions are always placed last. Give a disabled action a `disabledReason` (P-04).
- `secondaryActions` are buttons before the primary on wider windows; on a phone (below 600px) they move to the top of the "…" menu, so the header keeps one row. A page built on `PageHeader` gets the same with `<PageActions primary={…} secondary={[…]} menu={[…]} />`.
- Facts with an empty value are dropped. Keep them short: the line wraps.
- The tab lives in `?tab=`, and `"settings"` is always moved to the end. Stat cards belong in the Overview tab only.
- The breadcrumb follows the tab automatically (PageTabs sets the crumb tail; see `components/layout/crumb-tail.ts`). For a nested `PageTabs` inside a tab, pass `crumb="none"`.
- The route must declare the tabs: `teamTabs("sources/$sourceId", sourceTabs, …)`. If the page also uses `?record=` or list filters, use `tabSearch(tabs, { passthrough: true })`, or the router drops those parameters.

## SettingsPage

```tsx
<SettingsPage dirty={changed} saving={save.isPending} error={save.error} saveLabel="Save settings"
  onSave={() => save.mutate(form)} onDiscard={reset} canEdit={canEdit}
  message={invalid ? "Not saved: fix the highlighted field" : undefined} saveDisabled={invalid}>
  <SettingsSection title="General" description="…">…fields…</SettingsSection>
  <SettingsSection title="Crawling">…</SettingsSection>
  <DangerZone>
    <DangerAction title="Pause this source" description="…" action={<Button variant="secondary">Pause</Button>} />
    <DangerAction title="Delete this source" description="…" action={<Button variant="danger" onClick={…}>Delete source</Button>} />
  </DangerZone>
</SettingsPage>
```

- There is one form and **one** sticky save bar per page. Don't add Save buttons to sections.
- The unsaved-changes guard is built in. Leaving the page (a link, the sidebar or Back) asks "Leave without saving?", and closing the tab gets the browser prompt. Switching the page's tabs (`?tab=`) asks too, since the settings are one form (pass `guard={{ samePath: false }}` for a form that spans tabs).
- Danger-zone actions aren't part of the save: each one opens its own confirmation (`AlertDialog` / `ConfirmMutationDialog`). Use `disabledReason` when an action can't run, for example "You're the only owner".
- Field errors need text, not only a red border (F-05). Pass `error="…"` to `Field` and keep `invalid` in sync.

### Save conflicts (If-Match)

A form over an object with a revision holds its state in `useRevisionForm` and passes the control to the page (v0.4.2, AD-01):

```tsx
const [form, setForm, revision] = useRevisionForm(formOf(team), team.revision, { labels: { maxClassification: "Approved classification" } });
<SettingsPage revision={revision} dirty={…} onSave={() => save.mutate(form)} onDiscard={() => setForm(formOf(team))}>…</SettingsPage>
```

- When the object changes elsewhere while the person edits (another tab, another admin), or a save comes back 412, the form keeps their edits and takes the other changes into the fields they didn't touch. A notice lists what changed ("Description: now “…” (yours: “…”)"), and the save bar offers **Overwrite with mine** (saves the form on the latest revision) and **Discard mine and load theirs**.
- Their own save is told apart by its content (allowing for the server trimming text), so the form shows the saved values afterwards.
- **Don't key the editor by the revision** (`key={x.revision}`): that remounts it and throws the edits away. The mutation's If-Match uses the latest loaded revision; a 412 refetches every query (`main.tsx`), so the latest version arrives.
- A form with its own layout (not `SettingsPage`) renders `RevisionSaveBar` inside its `<form>` instead of a `SaveBar`.

## ListPage

```tsx
<ListPage<Source>
  id="team-sources"                  // remembers hidden columns per list
  title="Data sources" primaryAction={<Button>New source</Button>}
  caption="Data sources" columns={columns} data={rows} getRowId={(r) => r.id} rowLabel={(r) => r.name}
  facets={[{ id: "status", label: "Status", type: "toggle", allLabel: "All", accessor: (r) => r.status, options }]}
  search={{ label: "Search sources" }}
  rowActions={(r) => [{ label: "Open", render: <Link … /> }, { label: "Delete", danger: true, onSelect: … }]}
  empty={{ icon: <Database />, title: "No data sources yet.", action: <Button>New source</Button> }}
  loading={q.isLoading} error={q.error} onRetry={q.refetch}
/>
```

- Filters (`?status=failed`) and search (`?q=`) live in the URL and replace the history entry. Date facets use the same presets as `DateRangeFilter`.
- The search box's label is for screen readers; `search={{ label, showLabel: true }}` shows it above the box, like the filters' labels, where the placeholder alone wouldn't say what it searches.
- A single-choice toggle filter (Status: All · Active · Released) gets no "Status: Active ×" chip: its pressed item shows the choice. Other filters get a chip while active.
- Filtering is in memory by default. For server-side lists, read the values with `useListFilters(facets)`, pass them to the query, and set `manual` (plus `tableProps={{ loadMore }}` or `cursor`).
- Dates use `timeColumn(id, header, get)` or `<RelativeTime value=…/>`, which show relative text with the full date as the title.
- Rows that open a RecordPage get `onRowClick={(r) => record.open(r.id)}`: a click anywhere on the row (except its links and buttons) or Enter on the focused row opens it. Keep "View details" in the row menu too. Where people will want to open records in a new tab or copy their links, render the row header's name as `<RecordLink id={r.id}>` instead (a real link that opens in place on a plain click, like the knowledge base list's names) and leave `onRowClick` out: a link can't sit inside the row's open button.
- Fit at 1280 px: the list sits in a 976 px column there. Give long text a one-line `max-width` with an ellipsis (the full text as `title`), keep short cells `nowrap`, and start low-priority columns hidden (`defaultHidden`, still in the Columns menu). On a phone (below 600px) `defaultHiddenNarrow` columns start hidden too. A table never widens the page; it scrolls inside its own wrapper only as a last resort.
- Without `title`, only the table renders (for a list inside a tab or card).
- A small list leaves out the Columns menu with `tableProps={{ columnsMenuMin: 5 }}`: it shows once that many columns can be hidden, or once one is hidden (a `defaultHiddenNarrow` column on a phone), so a hidden column can always come back.
- `tableProps` passes anything else to `DataTable`: `selectable`, `bulkActions`, `toolbar`, `loadMore`, `cursor`, `defaultSort`, `stickyHeader`.

## Record and form pages (no side sheets)

The rule (owner decision, 2026-09-28): no drawers or side sheets. Short forms and confirmations are **dialogs** (`FormDialog`, `GuardedDialog`, `ConfirmMutationDialog`); records and long forms are **pages**. The only drawer left is the chat page's conversation list on narrow screens.

```tsx
const record = useRecordParam();         // ?record=<id>
…rowActions={(d) => [{ label: "View details", onSelect: () => record.open(d.id) }, …]}
…onRowClick={(d) => record.open(d.id)}
<RecordPage open={Boolean(record.id)} onClose={record.close} title={doc.data?.title ?? "Document"}
  description="A document in this source." loading={doc.isLoading} error={doc.error}
  facts={[{ label: "Status", value: … }, { label: "Size", value: … }]}
  sections={[{ title: "Passages", content: … }, { title: "Tags", content: … }]}
  actions={<><Button variant="danger">Delete</Button><Button>Re-fetch</Button></>} />

const form = useFormParam();             // ?form=new or ?form=<id>
<Button onClick={() => form.open("new")}>Add connection</Button>
{form.id && <FormPage label="Add connection" title="Add connection" description=… onClose={form.close}
  onSubmit={() => save.mutate()} submitLabel="Add connection" busy={save.isPending}>
  <FormSection title="Endpoint">…fields…</FormSection>
</FormPage>}
```

- A record or form page replaces the route's page in the main area; the list stays mounted underneath, hidden, so closing returns to the same filters and scroll position. Pages stack: an edit form opened from a record covers it.
- Each page has a back link ("← Back to Connections"), and its title is the last breadcrumb. The crumb under it closes it.
- `open(value)` pushes a history entry, so the browser's Back closes the page. A pasted link with `?record=` or `?form=` opens it directly; reloading keeps it open.
- Fetch the record by id (not from the list's page), so links work for rows that aren't loaded.
- A record opened from another record's page (a run's result) uses its own parameter: `useRecordParam("result")` and `<RecordPage param="result" …>` stack it over the first, and its back link returns there.
- A record's actions go in the header (`actions`: destructive first, the main action last). A form's buttons go under the form: Cancel, then the submit button; `startActions` holds "Change type" or a destructive action.
- `FormPage` asks "Leave without saving?" on Cancel, the back link and the breadcrumb once anything was typed or picked; pass `dirty` when the form tracks its own changes. A `RecordPage` with edits passes `dirty` too.
- After a create that goes to the new object's page, navigate with `replace: true`, so Back from it returns to the list, not to the form.

## DateRangeFilter

```tsx
const range = useDateRangeParam({ defaultPreset: "30d" });   // ?range=7d or ?range=2026-09-01/2026-09-26
<DateRangeFilter range={range} />
query: { from: range.fromDay, to: range.toDay }                  // date-only APIs (inclusive)
query: { from: range.from?.toISOString(), to: range.toExclusive?.toISOString() }   // RFC 3339 APIs
```

With a `defaultPreset` the default stays out of the URL and the range can't be cleared. Without one, clearing means "any time".

## Shell pieces for pages

- `useCrumbTail(label)` (`components/layout/crumb-tail.ts`) sets the last breadcrumb, for example a record name. PageTabs calls it for tabs.
- `NotFoundState` (`components/not-found.tsx`) renders the not-found page for an unknown team or object id. Use it instead of an inline error when the API returns 404.
- The team section of the sidebar, the team switcher and the ⌘K palette are handled by the shell. Pages don't need to register anything.
